Question:
You are given an m x n integer array grid. There is a robot initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). 
The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m-1][n-1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

An obstacle and space are marked as 1 or 0 respectively in grid. A path that the robot takes cannot include any square that is an obstacle.

Return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.

Example:
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right

Example
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]
Output: 1

Notes:
In this, if we go top down, we find that when we start the search from
grid[row][col]; then we can reach this position either from TOP and RIGHT
i.e (row-1, col) and (row, col - 1).
This forms our recursion.
Our Base Case would be if we go out of bounds then return 0 as there are no way to
reach the END if we start from OUT_OF_BOUND position.
Next Base Case id if we reach (0, 0), then here we know that if there is 1 way to
reach (0, 0) i.e if we start at that point then it will be counted as a way/path to
reach that point i.e (0, 0).
We use DP as dictionary which stores (i, j) as key for caching.
Conversion from rec + mem to Bottom-Up is simple.

Solution:
# Recursion + Memoization
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, row: int, col: int) -> int:
        def isValid(i, j, row, col):
            return 0 <= i < row and 0 <= j < col
        
        dp = {(0, 0): 1}
        def dfs(i, j, row, col):
            if isValid(i, j, row, col): 
                if (i, j) in dp: return dp[(i, j)]
                
                dp[(i, j)] = dfs(i-1, j, row, col) + dfs(i, j - 1, row, col)
                return dp[(i, j)]
            else:
                return 0
        
        dfs(row - 1, col - 1, row, col)
        return dp[(row - 1, col - 1)]


# Tabular DP
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        grid = [[1 for i in range(m)] for j in range(n)]
        grid[n-1][m-1] = 1
        row = n
        col = m
        
        for i in range(1,row):
            for j in range(1,col):
                grid[i][j] = grid[i-1][j] + grid[i][j-1]
                
        return grid[-1][-1]
