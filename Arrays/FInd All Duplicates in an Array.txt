Notes:
As here the array values are between 1 - len(arr); then we can traverse linearly
from 0 to len(arr);
then take the value i.e arr[i] as index and check 
if nums[arr[i]] < 0:
   then it's a duplicate,so append the index + 1 in ans to make it 1-based index
then convert the value to negative which indicates that it has been visited.
Here -ve number shows that the index has been visited.

Solution:
class Solution:
    def findDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        result = list()
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            index = abs(nums[i]) - 1
            if nums[index] < 0:
                result.append(index + 1)
            nums[index] = -nums[index] // or nums[index] * -1
        return result
