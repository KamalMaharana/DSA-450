Notes:
This question is similar to "Find All Duplicated in Array"
Here we use the Array-Index-Negative method.
We loop from 0 to N
get index = nums[i] - 1 (0-based indexing)
make nums[index] = - abs(nums[index]) i.e make it negative
So after this, all the numbers that are present will become -ve as they are visited
and all the number that remain +ve then their indexes are the DISAPPEARED values.

Solution:
class Solution:
    def findDisappearedNumbers(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        for i in xrange(len(nums)):
            index = abs(nums[i]) - 1
            nums[index] = - abs(nums[index])

        return [i + 1 for i in range(len(nums)) if nums[i] > 0]
