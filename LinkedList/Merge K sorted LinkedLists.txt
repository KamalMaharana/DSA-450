23. Merge k Sorted Lists

You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

Example 1:

Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
Example 2:

Input: lists = []
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: lists = [[]]
Output: []


Approach:
Use merge sort approach.
Go to middle, sort left half, sort right half, then merge both halves.
Here we recursively drill down to get single lists from the K lists of LinkedLists that we have.
Once we get down to single LinkedList in left and right pointer, we merge them 2 just like we do in 
Merge Sort with 2 arrays.

After this, once we get the combined LinkedList that is merged in a sorted manner, we roll up the recursion tree.
Till we merge all the LinkedLists present in the list.


Code:
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution(object):
    def mergeKLists(self, lists):
        if not lists:
            return None
        if len(lists) == 1:
            return lists[0]
        mid = len(lists) // 2
        l, r = self.mergeKLists(lists[:mid]), self.mergeKLists(lists[mid:])
        return self.merge(l, r)
    
    # Iterative way of merging 2 LinkedLists
    def merge(self, l, r):
        dummy = p = ListNode()
        while l and r:
            if l.val < r.val:
                p.next = l
                l = l.next
            else:
                p.next = r
                r = r.next
            p = p.next
        # This means, if l == None, take r, else r == None, take l.
        p.next = l or r
        # Dummy if used to keep track of head after all the manipulation of p, coz p will be at end after loop.
        return dummy.next
    
    # Recursive way of merging 2 LinkedLists
    def merge1(self, l, r):
        if not l or not r:
            return l or r
        if l.val< r.val:
            l.next = self.merge(l.next, r)
            return l
        r.next = self.merge(l, r.next)
        return r
