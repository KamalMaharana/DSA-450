Just count the number of components using DFS.
You can also use DSU to count the components
1. DSU:
 - After UNION of all edges, go thru parent array
 - Count all the values where parent[node] == node, all nodes that have themselves as parents are a different component
 - result = count - 1

2. DFS
 - Using for loop, count all the components
 - return count - 1
